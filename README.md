# Accenture Drupal 9 with BLT, GITLAB and LANDO
This repository consists of the Drupal 9, BTL, LANDO and GITLAB.

# Getting Started
This project is based on BLT 12.x with Lando local env, an open-source project template and tool that enables building, testing, and deploying Drupal installations following Acquia Professional Services best practices. While this is one of many methodologies, it is our recommended methodology.

1. Review the [Required / Recommended Skills](https://docs.acquia.com/blt/developer/skills/) for working with a BLT project.
2. Ensure that your computer meets the minimum installation requirements (and then install the required applications). See the [System Requirements](https://docs.acquia.com/blt/install/).


# How to start
1. Request access to organization that owns the project repo in GitLab (if needed).
2. Fork the project repository in GitLab.
3. Request access to the Acquia Cloud Environment for your project (if needed).
4. Setup a SSH key that can be used for GitLab and the Acquia Cloud (you CAN use the same key).
    1. [Setup GitHub SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
    2. [Setup Acquia Cloud SSH Keys](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-cloud/ssh/generate)
5. Clone your forked repository. By default, Git names this "origin" on your local.
```
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:dev808/orora.git

```

6. Install Composer dependencies.
After you have forked, cloned the project and setup your blt.yml file install Composer Dependencies. (Warning: this can take some time based on internet speeds.)
```
$ composer install
```
7. Setup Lando.
Setup the container by modifying your .lando.yml  with the configuration from this repositories [configuration files](#important-configuration-files).
```
$ lando start
```

8. Setup a local Drupal site with an empty database.
Use BLT to setup the site with configuration.  If it is a multisite you can identify a specific site.
```
$ lando blt setup
```

9. Log into your site with drush.
Access the site and do necessary work at #LOCAL_DEV_URL by running the following commands.
```
$ cd docroot
$ lando drush uli
```

---
## Other Local Setup Steps

1. Set up frontend build and theme.
By default BLT sets up a site with the lightning profile and a cog base theme. You can choose your own profile before setup in the blt.yml file. If you do choose to use cog, see [Cog's documentation](https://github.com/acquia-pso/cog/blob/8.x-1.x/STARTERKIT/README.md#create-cog-sub-theme) for installation.
See [BLT's Frontend docs](https://docs.acquia.com/blt/developer/frontend/) to see how to automate the theme requirements and frontend tests.
After the initial theme setup you can configure `blt/blt.yml` to install and configure your frontend dependencies with `blt setup`.

2. Pull Files locally.
Use BLT to pull all files down from your Cloud environment.
```
$ lando blt drupal:sync:files
```

3. Sync the Cloud Database.
If you have an existing database you can use BLT to pull down the database from your Cloud environment.
```
$ lando blt sync
```

# To start developing every time

1. Pull from the github repository
```
git pull
```

2. Create a new feature branch from develop
```
git checkout -b JIRA-000-feature-branch
```

3. Install Composer dependencies.
After you have forked, cloned the project and setup your blt.yml file install Composer Dependencies. (Warning: this can take some time based on internet speeds.)
```
$ composer install
```
4. Setup container
```
$ lando start
```

5. Setup a local Drupal site with an empty database. The blt-cohesion composer package will run all necessary site studio commands.
Use BLT to setup the site with configuration.
```
$ lando blt setup
```
or  If it is a multisite you can identify a specific site.
```
$ lando blt setup --site=blt-d9
```

6. Log into your site with drush.
Access the site and do necessary work at #LOCAL_DEV_URL by running the following commands.
```
$ cd docroot
$ lando drush uli
```



### To Create a Pull Request.

1. After you make changes inside your local drupal site. Export your configuration from the database to your configuration.
 Export your drupal config changes if you have them.
 ```
$ lando drush cex
```
To export Site studio configuration to your site studio package run the following command.
 ```
$ lando drush sync:export
```

2. commit your changes and push your changes to your origin repository.
```
$ git status
$ git add -p
$ git commit -m"blt-d9-000: Committing new changes to site."
$ git push --set-upstream origin blt-d9-000-new-site-change
```

3. Navigate to Github and open a pull request against the upstream. Assign a person on your team to review.

# GitLab CI/CD process overview
###To use GitLab CI/CD:

1. Ensure you have runners available to run your jobs.
2. If you donâ€™t have a runner, [install GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) and register a runner for your instance, project, or group.
3. Inspect the .gitlab-ci.yml file at the root of your repository. This file is where you define your CI/CD jobs.
When you commit the file to your repository, the runner runs your jobs. The job results are displayed in a pipeline.

### Important Configuration Files
BLT uses a number of configuration (`.yml` or `.json`) files to define and customize behaviors. Some examples of these are:

* `blt/blt.yml` (Global blt configuration)
* `blt/local.blt.yml` (local only specific blt configuration)
* `blt/ci.blt.yml` (ci/cd specific blt configuration)
* `lando.yml` (Lando configuration)
* `gitlab-ci.yml` (GitLab CD/CI configuration)
* `drush/sites` (contains Drush aliases for this project)
* `composer.json` (includes required components, including Drupal Modules, for this project)
* `docroot/sites/default/settings/local.settings.php` (Database + local configuration for Lando)
* `docroot/sites/default/settings/ci.settings.php` (Database configuration for CD/CI docker container)
